# MKS21X-FinalProject

Development Log

1/03: We have created the Square class, but are struggling with merging branches. We also started the Sudoku.java file.

1/04: Sabrina created the Sudoku class. She has completed the basis of our toString method, but we will try to improve it to resemble a sudoku board more. Kaitlyn worked on the Square class nad has created a new field to make it easier to know whether or not a square shows its number.

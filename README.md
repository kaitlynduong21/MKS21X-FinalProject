# MKS21X-FinalProject

Development Log

1/03: We have created the Square class, but are struggling with merging branches. We also started the Sudoku.java file.

1/04: Sabrina created the Sudoku class. She has completed the basis of our toString method, but we will try to improve it to resemble a sudoku board more. Kaitlyn worked on the Square class and has created a new field to make it easier to know whether or not a square shows its number.

1/05: We decided that it is better to use char[][] rather than use the Square class, so we have scraped the idea of Squares. Kaitlyn completed toStrings, getKey, and myBoard methods. She has also created a second constructor that will take in a seed, so that you can recreate the board you want.
